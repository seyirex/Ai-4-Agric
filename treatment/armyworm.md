### About this pest
AThe armyworm is native to North America and got their name by their army-like fashion of moving across fields. As the larvae consume the food available to them, they move as a whole group to a new food source, eating as they go. The weather can greatly affect armyworms; a wet and cool spring will favor their development but will hinder predator and parasite population.

### Prevention
Economic infestation does not typically happen on an annual basis. To develop economically damaging numbers of armyworms is dependent on spring moth flights, weather conditions, cropping practices and natural enemies. For most years, the population for armyworms is kept below damaging levels by the factors listed above. Start looking for signs of damage and larvae in early spring.

### Cultural Control
There are naturally occurring predators such as birds, lacewing, ladybugs, wasps, certain flies, rove beetles and ground beetles that are important for keeping the population of armyworms low each year. If you till your soil in the fall it will expose the pupae armyworms giving the birds a chance to pick them off. The risk of armyworm infestation can also be minimized by eliminating or controlling grassy weeds that are in and around fields. Handpicking the worms is also an option; once picked, the best disposal is putting them in a bucket of soapy water.

### Chemical Control
It is important that you do your best to avoid using harmful pesticides or practices that could injure beneficial insects, which should be your first line of control on armyworms. That being said, natural horticultural oil spray can be used on plants that are showing signs of infestation. Multi-purpose **neem oil spray** can be an effective control method of larvae. It is critical that there is complete coverage, including the junction with stems and the bottom side of the leaves. If you are looking to take chemical control, it is best applied to apply insecticides as soon as the economical threshold has been reached. One well-timed application of a registered insecticide with high clearance spraying equipment is typically best. Products that work well depending on your crop is Decis applied at 40-60 ml/per acre, Lorsban at 305-405 ml/acre, Lannate at 360-500 ml/acre, Monitor at 230-500 ml/acre and more, can provide adequate control. For the best control of armyworms, apply insecticides early in the morning or late evening when the larvae are active. Be sure to carefully read the label for cautions and proper application. It is extremely important to never spray on days that are windy or when temperatures are higher than 25Â°C.
