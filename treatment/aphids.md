### About this pest
Aphids typically feed in a group setting and with their piercing and sucking mouth pieces they attach to tender plant tissue and draw out large amounts of plant sap. In the past they have been known to cause curled leaves, discoloration, galls, swollen branches or wilted leaves. However, they typically do not cause permanent damage to the trees and shrubs they eat. Some aphids can produce large amounts of a sticky substance called honeydew. When honeydew is dropped on cars, sidewalks and other objects it can be extremely frustrating to remove. Honeydew is also an attraction for wasps, flies, bees and ants, which are great indicators that you may have an aphid infestation.

### Prevention
Prevention against aphids can be done by the removal of weeds. Aphids can live on many types of weed species that may or may not be reached by pesticides. Weeds that are not dealt with create an environment for aphids to establish and then rapidly spread.

### Cultural and Chemical Control

Aphids are quite defenseless pests and can often be controlled by natural enemies like aphidlions, birds, ladybird beetles and lacewings. Natural elements can also reduce the population of aphids by cold temperatures and heavy rain. If aphid infestations are detected early and before adult aphids have winged, control can be reached by spot treatments, or by removing infested plants. Once large infestations of aphids have been detected, they can be managed by horticultural oils and insecticidal soaps. If population of aphids have gotten out of control, use registered insecticides that contain either **diazinon**, **dimethoate**,**malathion**, or **permethrin**. Make sure that before application of any insecticide to scout for predators and double check that the insecticide is not toxic to the plants it will come in contact with.
