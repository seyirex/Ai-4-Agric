### About this pest
Cotton bollworm larvae damage bolls and squares. Larvae chew holes into the base of bolls and may hollow out locks. Moist frass usually accumulates around the base of the boll. Larvae may also chew shallow gouges in the boll surface, which can become infected with rot organisms.

Bollworm Complex Management and Control Methods
### Cultural Control
To assist in the suppression of bollworms in your crops, some cultural control methods you should consider: wherever possible, practice crop rotation with plants that are not desirable to the bollworm. Practice skip row irrigation or drip irrigation to avoid an excessive amount of irrigation. This can help decrease the chances of creating a favorable microclimate for this pest to build-up in. In infested cotton fields, you can plant sorghum or maize in-between rows to encourage the presence of aphids, who will feed on the bollworms. Placing bird perches in fields approximately 25 hectares away from each other can promote carnivorous birds such as Drongo and Myna to feed on the bollworm larvae. If you are protecting cotton crops, there is transgenic cotton available that can help keep the bollworm population to a minimum. It is important to note that having satisfactory control is often dependent on using an integrated management system that includes the use of both cultural and chemical methods.

### Chemical Control
Before treatment, you should check bollworm population levels to ensure there are approximately 20 larvae for every 100 plants. In this case, you can use chemicals such as chlorantraniliprole, flubendiamide, methomyl. Bacillus thuringiensis has proven to have successful results. Pyrethroids can also be effective when targeting adults or young larvae. Be sure to carefully read the label for cautions and proper application. It is extremely important to never spray on days that are windy. After applying insecticides it is important to irrigate sprayed area to increase the insect control. That being said, a large rainfall or irrigation soon after the application can reduce the concentration insecticides.
